# Research1

My focus is on leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques to strengthen the security of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. I'm fascinated by the potential of using ML algorithms to create adaptable defense mechanisms capable of autonomously detecting and countering a wide range of threats in real-time, such as DDoS attacks and data breaches. I'm particularly interested in conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of different ML approaches to uncover their strengths and effectiveness in enhancing IoT security. By addressing this research gap, I aim to contribute practical insights that can guide the implementation of robust security measures, ensuring the safe and continued growth of IoT technologies across various industries.
